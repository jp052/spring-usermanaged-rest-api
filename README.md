Spring Usermanaged Rest API
==============================

# Description

## Technologies
Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Hibernate, H2-Database.

## Goals
* The goal of this project is to provide a basic setup to create a user managed publicly accessible and protected Rest-API using api tokens.
* The sample application should eventually contain everything needed to be deployed in production, without simplifying things just for demonstration.
* Eventually this project should be split up in different microservices. 
The first version will be a monolytic application containing authentication, authorization, user management and business logic.

## Current development state
This project is in an early development state and not production ready.
